# Video Game Sales Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing video game sales data to gain insights into the gaming industry's trends and patterns. The dataset used contains information about various video games, including their platforms, genres, release years, sales in different regions, and global sales.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following key areas:

1. Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types to facilitate analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to explore the distribution of video games across platforms, genres, and years. Analyze sales trends in different regions and identify the top-selling games and platforms.

3. Genre Popularity Over Time: Analyze the popularity of different game genres over the years to identify genre trends.

4. Platform Popularity: Examine the popularity of gaming platforms based on the number of games released on each platform.

5. Top-Selling Games: Identify the top-selling games globally and analyze their sales.

## Data Visualization

The project utilizes various data visualization techniques, including:

- Bar plots: To visualize the number of games per platform, genre, and region-wise sales.
- Line plots: To showcase the trend of genre popularity over time and sales trends.
- Scatter plots: To study the relationship between variables like user scores and global sales.
- Pie charts: To visualize the distribution of game genres.

## Tools Used

The project is implemented using the following libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly: For interactive data visualization.
- Matplotlib: For creating additional visualizations.
